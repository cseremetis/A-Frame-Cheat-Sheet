## Getting Started

A-Frame is a javascript Virtual Reality library built on top of [Three JS](https://threejs.org). It is very new, as the first official
release has not yet been completed (Most current version is 0.8.0). Before starting with A-Frame it is necessary to create a web scaffold
with the following layout (or equivalent):

<tt>
MyWebsite
|
|--index.html
|--scripts
| 	|--AFrame.js
| 	|--script.js
|--images
		|--assets
</tt>

Include the url to the A-Frame Library at the <b>Head</b> of your index.html file in the form of a script tag:

<tt><script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.0/aframe.min.js"></script></tt>

Once the A-Frame Library is included, you may add more extensions <b>beneath it</b> still within the Head.
